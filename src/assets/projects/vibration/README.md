# Program to simulate vibration in rigid bodies
---
This work has the objective to implement a vibration analysis program. Where the user defines the physical matrices for the problem and the program executes a modal analysis on the subject.


## TODO:

* [ ] - Study dynamical systems enough to be capable of implementing all the mathematical procedures.
* [ ] - Come with matrix and mathematical operations that are necessary. 
    * [ ] - Low level eigenvalues and eigenvectors acquisition. 
    * [ ] - Low level matrix transposer.
    * [ ] - Some scalar operators like sqrt and the pi value.
* [ ] - Discover means of exposing the results (maybe some plotting libraries).

## Bonus:

* [ ] - Implement means for the user to introduce a stl so that he can see visually the results. (complex, go with caution)
